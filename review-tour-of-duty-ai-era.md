# Writing Style Review: tour-of-duty-ai-era.md

## Summary

This piece captures an interesting evolution of work models and includes engaging conversational snippets that show real thinking in progress. However, it reads more like brainstorming notes than a published research piece. The core ideas about tours of duty, AI augmentation, and the sports model are compelling but need development, clearer structure, and substantial citation to move from "budding" to publishable.

## Strengths

- **Conversational excerpts add authenticity** (lines 49-84, 105-144): The Slack/chat conversations effectively show how ideas develop through dialogue. The "bring your suite of agents" concept emerges naturally and feels fresh.
- **Sports analogy has explanatory power** (lines 96-102): The comparison to professional sports careers provides a concrete mental model for compressed, high-value employment periods.

## Critical Issues

1. **Missing essential context and links** (line 13): The opening references "our concept" and links to a Medium post from years ago, but readers unfamiliar with your previous work have no way to understand the original framework without clicking away. Consider summarizing the key points of the 2019 framework before diving into updates. The [[Wiki Link]] syntax isn't used where it should be—"infinite games" (line 90) is mentioned but not linked properly with bracket syntax.

2. **Uncited claims about market trends** (line 15): "There will be long-tail careers available in large companies, but there will also be a huge market for talent grabbing" is presented as fact without evidence. The bracketed note admits sources exist but aren't included. This fundamentally weakens the argument. Either cite the evidence now (signing bonuses, layoff data) or clearly mark this as hypothesis/observation rather than established fact.

3. **Incomplete thoughts and editorial notes left in** (lines 15-16, 90, 158): The bracketed "[there's a lot of evidence on this...]" and "[link to infinite games]" and "[link to the value note]" are editorial TODOs that should be resolved before publication. These break reader trust and signal the piece isn't ready.

4. **Unclear argument structure** (lines 17-20): Paragraphs 3-4 introduce ideas about "the grind" and "delegable workload" without clear connection to what came before or what follows. Who is experiencing this grind? What vision is being transcribed? The logic jump is confusing.

5. **Jargon without definition** (line 108): "disaggregation of that economic accumulation" sounds academic but obscures meaning. What does this mean in practice? Consider: "help distribute economic opportunity beyond the top 100 companies" or similar plain language.

## Important Issues

6. **Passive voice weakens key claims** (line 87): "What could a Tour of Duty look like?" introduces the 2026 framework, but the bullet points lack agency. "Define what zone of genius someone has demonstrated" - who is defining? The employer? Consider: "Companies should identify candidates' zones of genius..." to clarify roles and actions.

7. **Missing signal of idea maturity** (Throughout): The piece is tagged "status: budding" which helps, but individual claims vary wildly in their development. The 2019 framework is well-documented (lines 23-44), the agents-as-hiring-signal is speculative conversation (lines 49-84), and the sports model is somewhere between. Mark speculation explicitly: "We're exploring whether..." or "An emerging pattern suggests..."

8. **"Open Questions" section feels like writer's notes** (lines 156-162): While acknowledging uncertainty is good, this list reads more like a research agenda than insights for readers. Consider reframing these as "Key Challenges" and discussing each briefly, or integrating them into the main argument where they naturally arise.

9. **Weak transitions between sections** (line 94): The jump from "Agents as Hiring Signal" to "The Sports Model: A Third Path" lacks connection. How do these ideas relate? Consider a transition sentence: "This agents-as-portfolio idea pairs naturally with another model we've been considering: the professional sports approach to careers."

10. **Summary field in front matter differs from content** (line 9): The summary says "A new way of thinking about your career path" but the piece is more about *employment models* than individual career strategy. Consider: "How AI agents and sports-style trades might reshape employment relationships."

## Minor Suggestions

11. **Section title could be clearer** (line 147): "Tours of [Traded] Duty" is clever but the bracketed word makes it feel tentative. Either commit to "Tours of Traded Duty" or use "The Traded Model" or similar.

12. **Voice consistency** (lines 86, 149): The piece shifts between "we" (line 13), "I" (implied in line 143 conversation), and impersonal constructions (line 87). For ThinkNimble Research, default to "we" when sharing organizational thinking, and be explicit with "I" when attributing to Marcy specifically.

13. **Related Concepts links are incomplete** (lines 166-167): Good use of wiki-link syntax for "Pricing for Value Instead of Time" and "Agency of Agents," but these aren't introduced or connected to the main argument. A sentence explaining why these concepts matter would strengthen the knowledge web.

## Bottom Line

The ideas here are genuinely interesting—especially the agents-as-portfolio concept and the sports model for compressed, high-value employment. But this reads like notes toward a piece rather than a finished piece. To move from "budding" to publishable:

1. Resolve all bracketed TODOs with actual links and citations
2. Develop the core argument: What exactly are you proposing? How does AI change tours of duty?
3. Provide evidence for market trend claims or clearly label them as hypotheses
4. Define technical/business jargon on first use
5. Connect sections with clear transitions
6. Decide whether conversational snippets are illustrative examples or primary content (they work well as examples)

The raw material is solid. It needs structure, citations, and clarity to serve readers effectively.
