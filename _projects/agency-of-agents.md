config = AgencyConfig(
    openai_key="your-key",
    github_token="your-token",
    slack_webhook="your-webhook"
)

team = AgentTeam(config)
team.deploy_agents([
    "code_review",
    "documentation",
    "status_reporter"
])
```

## Integration Points

## Workflow Examples

### Automated Code Review
```python
# Triggered on PR creation
review = await agents.code_review.analyze_pr(pr_url)
await review.post_comments()
await review.update_status_checks()
```

### Daily Status Generation
```python
# Scheduled daily
status = await agents.status_reporter.generate_daily()
await status.send_to_client()
await status.post_to_slack()
```

### Sprint Planning
```python
# Run at sprint boundaries
plan = await agents.sprint_planner.create_sprint(
    backlog_items,
    team_capacity
)
await plan.create_tickets()
await plan.notify_team()
```

## Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Automate routine tasks, freeing developers for creative work
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform quality across all projects
- **Communication**: Keep clients and team members informed automatically
- **Quality**: Catch issues early with automated reviews and checks
