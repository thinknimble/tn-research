## Overview

TN Agent Launcher is a modern Python framework designed to simplify the deployment and orchestration of AI agents. It provides a robust infrastructure for managing multiple agents, handling their interactions, and scaling agent-based systems.

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Seamlessly work with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple agents working on complex tasks
- **Async First**: Built on AsyncIO for high-performance concurrent operations
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design for custom agent implementations
- **State Management**: Robust state handling for long-running agent tasks
- **Monitoring**: Built-in observability and logging for agent activities
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent rate limiting and resource allocation

## Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/thinknimble/tn-agent-launcher.git

# Or clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/thinknimble/tn-agent-launcher.git
cd tn-agent-launcher
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from tn_agent_launcher import AgentLauncher, Agent

# Define your agent
class ResearchAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, task):
        # Agent logic here
        return await self.llm.complete(task)

# Create launcher
launcher = AgentLauncher()

# Register agents
launcher.register(ResearchAgent())

# Launch agents with tasks
results = await launcher.execute([
    "Research the latest AI trends",
    "Summarize recent papers on LLMs"
])
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Agent Base Class**: Provides standard interface for all agents
- Lifecycle management (init, run, cleanup)
- State persistence
- Error handling
- Logging integration

**Launcher Engine**: Orchestrates agent execution
- Task queue management
- Resource allocation
- Concurrent execution
- Result aggregation

**Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for LLM providers
- Automatic failover
- Rate limiting
- Token management
- Cost tracking

### Agent Types

- **Task Agents**: Single-purpose agents for specific tasks
- **Workflow Agents**: Multi-step agents that coordinate sub-tasks
- **Monitor Agents**: Observe and report on other agent activities
- **Tool Agents**: Agents that interact with external tools and APIs

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Providers
```python
from tn_agent_launcher import Provider

class CustomProvider(Provider):
    async def complete(self, prompt, **kwargs):
        # Custom implementation
        pass

launcher.add_provider(CustomProvider())
```

### Agent Communication
```python
# Agents can communicate through shared context
class CoordinatorAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, task):
        # Delegate to other agents
        result = await self.send_to("researcher", subtask)
        return self.process(result)
```

### Scaling
```python
# Configure for production
launcher = AgentLauncher(
    max_concurrent=10,
    timeout=300,
    retry_policy=ExponentialBackoff(),
    monitoring=PrometheusMonitor()
)
```

## Use Cases

- Building autonomous AI systems
- Research automation
- Content generation pipelines
- Code analysis and generation
- Customer service automation
- Data processing workflows

## Performance

- Handles 100+ concurrent agents
- Sub-second agent startup time
- Automatic resource optimization
- Built-in caching for common operations
