## Overview

TN Office Unity brings the ThinkNimble office to life as an interactive 3D environment accessible directly in your web browser. This project showcases the potential of WebGL and Unity for creating immersive virtual spaces without requiring any downloads or installations.

## Features

- **Browser-Based**: No downloads required - runs entirely in modern web browsers
- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Explore a fully realized virtual office space
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop and mobile devices with WebGL support
- **Optimized Performance**: Carefully tuned for smooth performance across devices
- **Custom Shaders**: Enhanced visual effects using ShaderLab and HLSL

## Technical Implementation

Built with Unity's WebGL export capabilities, the project demonstrates:
- Efficient 3D asset optimization for web delivery
- Custom shader development for unique visual effects
- Cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Virtual Collaboration

This project was created during the shift to remote work, exploring how virtual environments can maintain team connection and culture. It serves as both a technical demonstration and a creative approach to remote team building.

## Browser Compatibility

The virtual office runs best on:
- Chrome 86+
- Firefox 79+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 86+

Mobile devices are supported but desktop browsers provide the best experience.
