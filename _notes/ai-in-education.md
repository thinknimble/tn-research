## AI-Native Schools: Alpha School and the New Education Movement

[Alpha School](https://alpha.school/) is definitely something to keep an eye on.

Here's their list of "other schools" in the footer:

- [Future of Education](https://linktr.ee/Futureof_Education)
- [GT School](https://gt.school/)
- [Texas Sports Academy](https://sportsacademy.school/)

## AI in College Admissions: Virginia Tech's Implementation

Interesting story out of my mom's alma mater. [Virginia Tech Adopts AI into the Admissions Process](https://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia-tech-adopts-artificial-intelligence-into-the-admissions-process/article_ce72401d-78d8-46a7-82ab-2a01e404c5c4.html)

I think a lot of colleges and other programs that take applications will adopt this strategy. Personally, I believe this is something AI is particularly good at and initial screenings based on a structured rubric are an appropriate use of Generative AI (and computers in general), but I can understand if this feels uncomfortable or dystopian! On the flip side, I'm sure there are some students pushing the boundary of ethics when it comes to using Generative AI to write their applications. How long before the entire process is just AIs talking to each other!?

For what it's worth, it does not seem the decision was made lightly:

The decision to incorporate AI into the admissions process followed three years of research done by admissions staff and faculty in the College of Engineering. According to Virginia Tech News, the AI reviewer uses internal university resources.

"We've got three years of work and study to see how it can help our process, and the assessment of it will begin moving forward with the actual admissions process," Owczarski said.

### Details of VA Tech's Implementation

Virginia Tech implemented an AI system on August 1, 2025, for the fall 2027 application cycle, following a 10.2% increase in applications for fall 2025.

The AI system:

- Replaces one human reader in the application review process
- Uses a rubric-based evaluation system for complete applications (test scores, transcripts, extracurriculars, campus visits)
- Reduces the review threshold from a 4-point to 2-point difference between reviewers
- Was developed over three years of research by admissions staff and College of Engineering faculty
- Utilizes internal university resources

Mark Owczarski, Virginia Tech spokesperson, noted: "Artificial intelligence helps us to read our growing number of essays quicker, with more accuracy and consistency."

**Human oversight remains:** Virginia Tech maintains that human judgment remains active in decision-making, with researchers monitoring AI consistency and the admissions team tracking trends to improve the system.
