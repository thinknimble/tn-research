summary: "As AI makes code cheaper to produce, will we see fewer or more programmers? Economics offers contradictory answers. Unlike economic deflation, programming deflation is driven by productivity gains - but the middle disappears as code becomes commodity and quality bifurcates."

## The Core Paradox

AI makes code steadily cheaper. Two contradictory economic predictions:

**Substitution Effect**: Machines replace human labor → fewer programmers  
**Jevons' Paradox**: When something becomes cheaper, demand explodes → more programmers

**Deflationary Spiral**: If code will be cheaper tomorrow, why not wait? This defers investment → less activity → lower prices → more deferral.

## Programming Deflation ≠ Economic Deflation

**Traditional deflation**: Destructive, reflects economic weakness (falling demand, broken confidence, shrinking money supply)

**Programming deflation**: Driven by **genuine productivity gains**. AI isn't redistributing the same pie - it's making pie-making fundamentally cheaper.

This creates unique dynamics:

### 1. Delay vs. Experiment Paradox

Yes, better tools tomorrow. But when experimentation costs approach zero, **the urge to try something NOW often wins**.

How many of us spin up quick prototypes just because we can?

### 2. Quality Bifurcation

- **Cheap code floods the market** (most of it terrible)
- Gap between commodity code and carefully crafted software **widens**
- **The middle disappears**

### 3. Value Migration

Writing code becomes like **typing** - a basic skill, not a career.

**Value moves to**:
- Understanding what to build
- How systems fit together
- Navigating complexity of infinite cheap software pieces

### 4. The Reinforcing Loop

Unlike traditional deflation, cheaper tools might **accelerate innovation** when programming accelerates programming:
- Better tools → Better models → Better tools
- The loop speeds up, not slows down

## The Publishing Analogy

1995: Publishing was expensive, exclusive  
2000s: Publishing became free  

**Result**: Not less publishing - **explosion of content**
- Most of it terrible
- Some of it revolutionary

Same pattern emerging with code:
- Every small business becomes software company
- Every individual becomes developer
- Cost of "what if we tried..." approaches zero

## What To Do During Deflation

### 1. Embrace the Commodity
Use the cheap tools. Build obvious stuff with AI. Save energy for hard problems.

### 2. Focus on Integration
Bottleneck isn't writing code anymore. It's **making cheap software pieces work together coherently**.

### 3. Develop Taste
When anyone can build anything, **knowing what's worth building** becomes the skill.

### 4. Think in Systems
Individual programs are commoditized. **Complex, adaptive systems are not**.

## What Becomes Scarce

In a world of abundant cheap code:

**Scarce resources**:
- Understanding
- Judgment
- Ability to see how pieces fit together
- **Wisdom to know what not to build**

## The Beautiful Thing

These skills matter **whether we get fewer programmers OR more programmers**:

**Scenario A (fewer programmers)**: Human skills become the differentiator  
**Scenario B (more programmers)**: These skills separate signal from noise

**The strategy**: Build capabilities that thrive in either scenario. Don't predict which future - prepare for both.

## Competitive Positioning

Cultivating judgment improves position vs. those who use tools simply to **churn out same features faster**.

It's not about speed. It's about **what you choose to build** and **how it fits together**.

## The Unanswered Question

**How do we cultivate broad engineering skills when narrow AI-assisted roles are more immediately profitable?**

This is the tension organizations must navigate. Short-term efficiency gains (narrow specialists + AI) vs. long-term resilience (broad understanding + judgment).

**Curator's Note**: Kent Beck's framing of programming deflation as fundamentally different from economic deflation is crucial. The reinforcing loop (better tools enable better tools) breaks the traditional deflationary spiral model. The advice to "build capabilities that thrive in either scenario" is the most pragmatic response I've seen to AI uncertainty.

**Key insight**: The middle is disappearing. Commodity code and craft code are diverging. Choose which side you're on.
