## Core Argument

AI code generation (like AI-generated music or text) thrives in environments where **optimization trumps craft**—where "good enough" output that maximizes metrics is sufficient. However, this perpetuates and accelerates the systemic software quality problems that plague the industry.

## The Technique Framework

Drawing on Jacques Ellul's concept of **"technique"** (the reduction of activity to efficient means toward measured ends):

- Software at large companies has become technique-driven: optimizing for metrics over craft
- AI agents are the logical extension of this mindset
- Quality, beauty, and human dignity are casualties of pure optimization

### Spotify vs Bandcamp as Microcosm

**Bandcamp** (craft-focused):
- Personal curation, full albums
- Spawned genuine indie artists (Car Seat Headrest, Mitski, Phoebe Bridgers)
- Platform values music as art

**Spotify** (technique-focused):
- Algorithmic recommendations, playlist optimization
- Produces bland, algorithmically-targeted muzak
- Music becomes means to engagement metrics

**Connection to code**: The same dynamic plays out in software—systems optimized purely for metrics produce low-quality output.

## The Software Crisis Predates AI

The author argues current software is already deeply flawed:

1. **Large tech companies resemble "plumbing"** - connecting systems, not building great work
2. **Bloated, poorly-designed, badly-documented** systems are the norm
3. **Narrow specialization** - engineers trained only to operate within big tech structures
4. **Loss of craft** - quality not rewarded, broad skills atrophy

> "Most large software systems are bad: bloated, poorly-designed, badly-documented... Users are at war with platforms, lest they be taken advantage in the process of enshittification."

## Why AI Seems Threatening (But Isn't)

AI coding agents **appear** capable of replacing engineers because:

1. Much software work has become **rote and narrow**
2. For producing "good enough" low-quality code, **AI is actually quite good**
3. The celebration of AI capabilities requires **extreme narrowness of vision** about what software is

### The Compiler Analogy Fallacy

The claim that AI is "like a compiler" that translates human language to code requires believing:
- Software is purely means to an end
- "Good enough" is the only standard
- No place for higher-minded ideals of craft

## Real Limitations of AI Agents

After experimentation, the author identifies concrete limits:

1. **They lie and don't truly understand**
2. **They generate verbose, braindead style code**
3. **Flat, ugly designs** with unpleasant "tells"
4. **Mindless debugging loops** - "no, there's a bug, please fix it"
5. **Work best for well-defined, already-solved problems** (unit tests, simple DB functions)
6. **Generalization attempts have largely failed**

Quote from reference:
> "attempts to generalize their capabilities have largely failed and produced code that is novel and impressive only in its monstrosity."

## The Arts & Crafts Response

Drawing parallels to the **Arts and Crafts movement** during the second industrial revolution:

- John Ruskin and William Morris responded to impressive industrial production
- They didn't celebrate machines replacing craftsmen
- Saw industrial production as having a particular (harmful) style
- Workers became cogs in machinery

**Modern parallel**: AI allows faster production of not-very-good software, but cannot solve the main systemic problem: **we still haven't figured out how to build software well at scale**.

## The Real Path Forward

> "to do this requires a sense of craft and real human critical thought."

The software industry's core problem isn't lack of speed—it's lack of **craft, quality, and systems thinking**. AI accelerates production but doesn't address these fundamental gaps.

## Connections

### Related Notes

- **[[ai-adoption-divide]]** - Contrasts with Steve Yegge's "maximalist" position that AI will replace senior developers; this argues seniors' craft and critical thinking remain essential
- **[[complexity-collapse-llms]]** - Provides evidence for the claim that AI "largely failed" at generalizing capabilities
- **[[distribution-vs-depth]]** - The technique vs craft tension mirrors the distribution vs depth tension in AI work
- **[[command-line-for-everyone]]** - Both advocate for genuine skill/craft over pure automation

### Related Essays

- **[[reasonable-starter-opinion-on-ai]]** - This critique provides depth to the "limitations" side of any balanced AI opinion

## Key Themes

1. **Optimization vs Craft** - AI excels where craft doesn't matter; fails where it does
2. **Systemic vs Symptomatic** - Speed isn't the problem; systemic quality issues are
3. **Historical Parallels** - Industrial revolution → Arts & Crafts // AI revolution → ?
4. **Human Capital** - Society's capacity depends on broadly-skilled engineers, not narrow specialists

## Open Questions

1. What does an "Arts & Crafts movement" for software look like in the AI era?
2. Can companies balance AI-accelerated production with genuine craft?
3. How do we cultivate broad engineering skills when narrow AI-assisted roles are more immediately profitable?
4. Is the "technique" mindset now inevitable in software, or can craft make a comeback?

**Curator's Note**: This piece provides crucial counterweight to AI maximalism. While it may overstate AI limitations (tools are improving rapidly), the core argument about **craft mattering** and **systemic quality issues** remains vital. The Spotify/Bandcamp parallel is particularly illuminating.
