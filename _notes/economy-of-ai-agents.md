## Overview

**Type**: Academic research paper / survey chapter  
**Published**: September 2025  
**Subject Areas**: General Economics, Artificial Intelligence, Multiagent Systems

## Abstract Summary

In the coming decade, AI agents capable of planning and executing **complex tasks over long time horizons** with minimal human oversight may be deployed across the economy.

This chapter surveys recent developments and highlights open questions for economists around:

### Three Key Areas

1. **Agent-to-Agent and Agent-to-Human Interactions**  
   How will AI agents interact with each other and with humans in economic contexts?

2. **Market and Organizational Impacts**  
   How will AI agents shape markets and organizational structures?

3. **Institutional Requirements**  
   What institutions are needed for well-functioning markets with AI agents?

## Why This Matters

The paper frames AI agents as **economic actors**, not just tools. This shifts the analysis from "how do we use AI?" to "how do we structure economies where AI is an independent participant?"

### Implications

- **Contract law**: How do contracts work when one party is an agent?
- **Liability**: Who's responsible when agent makes bad decision?
- **Market design**: How to prevent agent collusion, manipulation?
- **Trust mechanisms**: How do humans verify agent behavior?
- **Resource allocation**: How do agents compete for compute, data, human attention?

## Open Questions (Implied)

While full paper access needed for details, the abstract suggests investigation of:

- **Coordination problems**: Agent-to-agent coordination mechanisms
- **Information asymmetry**: Agents may have info advantages over humans
- **Principal-agent problems**: Classic economic problem amplified with AI agents
- **Market microstructure**: How agent trading/interaction changes market dynamics
- **Organizational design**: When to use agents vs. humans for different roles

## Research Needed

**Note**: Full paper access needed to extract specific findings, frameworks, and recommendations. This abstract indicates the **scope** but not the **substance** of the research.

**Next steps**: 
- Obtain full PDF
- Extract key frameworks for agent economy design
- Identify which open questions have proposed solutions vs. remain unsolved

**Curator's Note**: The framing of AI agents as economic actors (not just tools) is crucial. Most AI discussions focus on productivity or replacement - this examines the institutional infrastructure needed for agent economies. The emphasis on "well-functioning markets" suggests market failure modes when agents participate. Full paper review needed to extract actionable insights.

**Priority**: HIGH - this could provide theoretical grounding for practical agent deployment decisions.
