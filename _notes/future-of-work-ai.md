## Overview

How does work change when AI compresses timelines, commoditizes code, and inverts traditional hierarchies? This note collects external sources alongside ThinkNimble's own thinking on tours of duty, value pricing, and learning reinvestment.

## The Adoption Divide

Steve Yegge's ["Revenge of the Junior Developer"](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer) argues AI is inverting developer hierarchies: juniors adopt faster, cost less, and have their productivity gaps closed by AI. His claim that software development is now "pay-to-play" at $50K/year per developer in LLM spend is provocative. Nolan Lawson's [counterpoint](https://nolanlawson.com/2025/04/02/ai-ambivalence/) notes that senior experience in architecture, debugging, and system design still matters. The real divide isn't junior vs. senior - it's AI maximalists vs. pragmatists.

## AI Adoption as Complex Contagion

Lewis Kallow argues that [AI tools spread like complex contagions](https://every.to/p/ai-can-build-anything-social-dandelions-decide-what-spreads), not simple viral products. Complex contagions require multiple trusted recommendations from within dense communities - the Iowa corn study showed 70% of farmers *knew* about hybrid corn but less than 1% adopted it until they saw trusted neighbors succeed. The key: target "social dandelions" (the most socially active people, not the most popular) within tight-knit communities. This explains why Slack targeted active individual contributors rather than CIOs, and why AI coding tools spread organically through dev teams while top-down mandates fail.

## Workforce Upskilling at Scale

[OpenAI's Jobs Platform and Certification program](https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/) targets 10 million Americans certified by 2030, with partners including Walmart (2.1M U.S. employees), Indeed, BCG, and Accenture. The interesting question isn't whether they'll hit the number but whether certifications become meaningful signal or checkbox credentials. Upskilling programs have a mixed track record historically.

## ThinkNimble's Original Thinking

These notes by Marcy Ewald and the ThinkNimble team develop an original framework for how work, pricing, and leverage change in the AI era:

- **[[Tour of Duty in the AI Era]]** - The sports-model "third path": deep engagements where experts embed for concentrated periods, bring their suite of agents, get premium compensation, then move on. Agents as hiring signal.
- **[[Pricing for Value Instead of Time]]** - Five dimensions of value beyond hourly billing (knowledge, speed, option value, funding catalyst, risk mitigation). The "dark side of the moon" problem of proving value.
- **[[Distribution vs Depth: Thoughts on Learning Reinvestment]]** - The leverage problem: how to extract deep insights from bespoke consulting into broadly applicable solutions. The learning triangle (deep → productized → scaled) and the reinvestment cycle.

### What's Actually Hard?

Clay Hebert's viral observation - ["Now that anyone can build an app, everyone finally realizes that building the app wasn't the hard part"](https://x.com/clayhebert/status/2009263511491297555) - prompted a team discussion about what *is* the hard part, and how ThinkNimble should position around it.

I think this is a great way of framing our pitch.

Okay, here's a question. If you had to clearly articulate to a layperson what is "the hard part," what would you say? I have my answer, but I'm curious what you would say.

His answer is that the hard part was marketing and distribution. Someone outlined a hierarchy where engineering is #4 out of 4. I don't like these status games and it perpetuates the toxicity I've fought against my whole career. So my stance is ... definitely not that 😄

I do value marketing, sales, and distribution. I think engineers don't give it enough credit, and engineers actively make other people feel dumb, but it's because they feel bullied and jerked around by people who are exploring the market. Engineers characterize this as "they don't know what they want."

I do think the hard part has always been PMF. The best way to get PMF is to have everyone aligned on the design process. In our hypothesis terms: here's what we think the market is telling us, so here's the product / feature we're building, we need to build and ship it fast so go-go engineers, but it might not work so get ready to delete it and try something else.

My rough stance is that everyone needs to be a participant in that design process and AI is pushing everyone's jobs closer together. Specialization matters less and the need for speed in SDLC cycles is greater than ever.

I'm writing some stuff going back and forth with Claude and I wrote this, which I think captures my view:

"I think all of the above. We have years of frameworks to help companies be hypothesis-driven from start to finish. One thing I say is that an investment pitch can be re-framed as 'In order for my business to work these 10 things must be true. I am building an experiment to prove those 10 things true or false.' It's very rare that one of those hard-to-prove things is 'building an app' or even 'making a really nice UI.' There are some times this important, but it's less important than people think. Product market fit, go to market, value produced, market sizing, revenue model - all those are more 'hard to prove' than the tech. At least for tech startups, oftentimes the tech is **THE TOOL** to conduct those experiments, not an experiment in and of itself. Building an app is the easy part. Making the app's development part of the journey of your business strategy the hard part. Losing sight of this is a big issue."

ha, here's claude's first shot at my response:

"Right, and the hard part was always figuring out what to build — the hypothesis, the scoping, the translation of business value into something a developer can actually execute on. That's what we've been selling for 15 years, we just didn't have language for it because the coding was the visible work."

And then probably: "This is exactly why we need to be positioning above the AI line. The app-building commoditizes, but the knowing-what-matters doesn't. That's pattern recognition. That's the 200 apps. That's why Forward Deployed Engineering is the play — you're not paying for the code, you're paying for someone who can look at your messy problem and know which 20% of it actually needs to get built first."

You might also add that this is why the test-first gate matters more now, not less. If anyone can vibe-code an app, the bottleneck shifts entirely to specification quality. The people who can write a tight hypothesis and testable acceptance criteria become more valuable, not the people who can implement them.

The thing that keeps coming up in my head is William's surgeon metaphor -- being able to rapidly test toward that north star in small, discrete chunks, differentiates between excellent developers and intermediate ones. The hard part is creating these testable feedback loops, and the nice thing is they can happen faster, to move you toward PMF.

### The Shape of Future Software

> GenAI is already capable of generating interactive worlds and interfaces. It's fascinating to imagine what software will look like when that goes mainstream. I imagine it will be less rigid, more fluid, tactile, and organic like the real world.
