For 15 years, Marcy has been giving bootstrapped founders and industry experts the same tools and processes that funded startups use to change the world. As COO of ThinkNimble, she's helped launch 100+ products by entrepreneurs who had expertise but not engineering teams, vision but not venture capital.

Now, as part of ThinkNimble's research lab, she's exploring how AI can democratize entrepreneurship even further by helping knowledge workers and industry experts reclaim control over their work and build businesses or tools that matter. Her research focuses on the meta-patterns of successful small businesses: what makes it possible to compete in an economy increasingly dominated by large players, and how technology can level that playing field.
